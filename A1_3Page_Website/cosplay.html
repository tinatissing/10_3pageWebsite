    <p>Cosplaying is dressing up as a character from a movie, book, tv show, anime, or video game. You can have casual cosplayers, people who only cosplay every year or so, serious cosplayers, people who cosplay at multiple conventions a year, and professional cosplayers, people who get paid to model their cosplays. I fall into the serious cosplayer category, wearing many different outfits at conventions such as <a href="https://www.fanexpocanada.com/en/home.html">Fan Expo</a>, <a href="http://comicontoronto.com/">Comic Con</a>, and Fan Days.</p></td>

I've fallen in love with cosplaying and to me it's more than just a hobby. It takes a whole lot of time, tons of hard work, unreal effort, and one annoyed sister to create these masterpieces but the payoff is amazing.</p></td>

    <td colspan="2"><p>I never know how much time I will have to create these cosplays, so every year I make a "cos-plan" which is my list of cosplays that I am planning on making. Unfortunately, I can only do so much and I end up having to make and pass on certain cosplays depending on my time restraint and other limitations. This year I plan to possibly cosplay as...
    <ul>
    	<li>Human form of Garatina - Pokemon Platinum</li>
        <li>Genderbent Aladdin - Aladdin</li>
        <li>Sailor Saturn - Sailor Moon</li>
        <li>Dark Pit - Kid Icarus Uprising</li>
        <li>Dark Link - Legend of Zelda</li>
   	</ul>
    Garatina is my priority cosplay this year which means I am focussing on working on that cosplay the most. My Garatina cosplay is currently planned to have huge articulating wings (the big attention grabbing point of the cosplay) that span about a meter and a half on each size. These cosplays (depending on which ones I end up actually finishing), will be worn at this years Fan ExpoAugust 30th - September 2nd. I work hard, and do my best to look amazing and do my characters justice.</p>
